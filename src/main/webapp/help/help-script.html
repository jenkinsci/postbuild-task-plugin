<div>
  Specify the shell script to be executed when the execution of the task is selected.
  This is where the actual work happens. When the script executes, the current directory
  will be <a href="../ws/">the workspace directory</a>, just like the shell script builder.

  So depending on your SCM, you might have to cd into a directory. Try "pwd" and "ls" to
  find out whether you need that or not.

  References %1, .. %n are allowed, and will be replaced by the groups matched by the
  Regex. %0 is the whole match.
